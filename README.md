# Bioinformatic Pipeline for Analyzing Development Reprogramming in Heat Call Exposed Embryos

## Epigenetic Reprogramming Analysis: Complete and Annotated Workflow

**This pipeline is designed for robust, reproducible analysis of RRBS and RNA-seq data, integrating advanced normalization, network analysis, differential methylation, differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, and cell-type deconvolution in a single workflow.**

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Setup and Data Preparation
- **Input:** Raw RRBS methylation files, sample metadata  
- **Tasks:** Load packages, set working directory, load sample metadata, prepare methylation file lists

### 2. Data Import and Preprocessing
- **Tools:** `methylKit`, `tidyverse`, `dplyr`  
- **Tasks:** Import methylation data, add sample-specific covariates (e.g., sex), filter samples based on availability

### 3. Quality Control and Filtering
- **Tasks:** Visualize methylation and coverage statistics for all samples, filter samples by coverage to ensure data quality

### 4. Differential Methylation Analysis
- **Tasks:** Merge samples, perform differential methylation analysis (including sex as a covariate), extract significantly differentially methylated CpGs, analyze treatment effects separately for males and females

### 5. Summary and Comparison
- **Tasks:** Summarize and compare differential methylation results across sexes, report overlap of differentially methylated CpGs

### 6. Gene Annotation
- **Tools:** `GenomicRanges`  
- **Tasks:** Annotate differentially methylated CpGs with gene information using genomic coordinates, save annotated results for manual review

### 7. Interaction Analysis (Sex Ã— Treatment)
- **Tasks:** Create interaction factors, re-analyze methylation data for interaction effects, perform pairwise comparisons between treatment groups, annotate and summarize results

### 8. Additional Analyses and Visualization
- **Tasks:** Load and analyze specific methylation files, generate publication-ready boxplots and interaction plots for selected regions

### 9. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis
- **Tools:** `goseq`, `geneLenDataBase`, `org.Gg.eg.db`  
- **Tasks:** Prepare gene universe for GO analysis, perform enrichment analysis, visualize top enriched GO terms

- Optionally filter gene list for tissue-specific (e.g., hypothalamic) analysis

### 23. Differential Expression Analysis
**Tasks:**
- Construct DESeq2 object from imported data  
- Filter low-count genes  
- Perform differential expression analysis with DESeq2  
- Extract and shrink log2 fold changes for robust gene ranking  
- Save results for downstream analysis

### 24. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
**Tasks:**
- Load gene set files (Hallmark, KEGG, GO)
